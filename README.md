# (Codename) Backalley

## Object oriented framework for developing Wordpress admin panel.

**This project is currently in early development, therefore it is recommended when
using to specify at least the minor version in your composer.json.**

**Also, components will eventually extracted into separate libraries and the name
may be completely different when that happens. So really, in the meantime, use in
production at own risk!**
